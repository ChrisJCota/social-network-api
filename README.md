# social-network-api


## Description
This is an API where different users can share their thoughts and reactions as well as create a friend list. This project uses `Express.JS` for routing, a `MongoDB Database`, a `Mongoose ODM`, the seed data is created using `insomnia`

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to use a real life example to practice and seed `MongoDB`

## Usage 
To start the application, run `npm start`
The mongoose models should then be synced to your DB
Open MongoDB and connect using the `mongodb://localhost:27017` URI. You should see a thoughts and users folder inside the db
To create seed data and test api routes use `insomnia`
